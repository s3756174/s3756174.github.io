					<h3>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
          </h3>
					<p class="mb-0">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a stimulation of performing tasks that related to human intelligence using the computer systems. It is a science that have different ways to approach including system management, natural language process or visual and voice-recognition system. There are three common stages needed to build up an AI that I have concluded; the first stage is the AI is learning through collecting data and making rules to change the data into information. The information such as algorithms and regulations will be provided for the computer system to perform specific missions or requests. In the second stage is when AI focuses on selective the right information and algorithms to answer the right requests which it can achieve the desired results and the third stage is when AI can automatically adjust which algorithms and information to give the most correct answer. AI has two types; the Narrow AI, which is also means Weak AI, this one built with a limitation in context and information so it can only perform the simplest tasks that based on human intelligence. The next one is the Strong AI (Artificial General Intelligence), this one is a higher level of the Narrow one because it can think more complicated and automatically process their own logical responses that are like a human being language. AI is when the system is trying to mimic human, so Machine learning is important for building an AI. This is a simple way for developers because with machine learning, they can get rid of doing more coding, what they need to do is putting in the already programmed tasks to help the AI responses to be concise due to more difficult tasks. According to Sam Shead, in 2016, there are more investors want to spend their money into producing Artificial Intelligence (Sam Shead, 2016). Nowadays, AI can be used many different areas like healthcare system to diagnose the sicknesses or speech recognition that provided on mobile phone and especially, online customer services on e-commerce platform that can personalize the customer’s experiences. For example, Amazon can predict the number of customers that have intention to buy the products by using AI to provide a recommendation engine for the customers and it has driven 35% of their total sales (Sejuti Das, 2020). Linked to my E-learning Social Media Platform, AI can be used to automatically update new learning content that does not human interaction. AI can also be an online tutor that can support learners during their sections with real-time questions (Naveen Neelakandan, 2019).

                        Artificial Intelligence is applied to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the workplace by freeing the work force from complicate or dangerous tasks. More people can apply for jobs that require creativity leading to their job satisfaction. For example, with my project, more people can create their own content that can help others to learn new things instead of entering the physical section with the same thing. However, there might be some issues due to morality if applying to much AI. Old people who are living with the past and for the present, they might not be able to adapt with the speedy changing in life. Due to cutting off workers by companies to apply AI to reduce cost, many old people can get fired and lose their salary because they cannot apply for new modern jobs that require modern skills. So, this problem could be considered again.
<hr>
                        In my daily life, I have experienced with many applications and things that use Artificial Intelligence to work. Firstly, I spend most of the day to research about definition or solution that can help me to solve the problems that I am facing with and Google Search is the best tool that people around the world are using to learn more about new aspects such as careers, healthcare, or interesting things. By applying AI to collect data that users search most, Google can provide thousands of answers that are most relevant to the users’ questionnaires. I also use Netflix to entertain everyday by watching many movies, at the beginning, I was surprised how can Netflix recommend me categories of movies that I would like to see in the future. After research more about Netflix, I realized that they have apply AI that is built up with algorithms that can give recommendations for watchers through the types of movies that they watch the most. AI has supported me in everything at the current from learning to entertaining, in my opinion, AI can create emotional interaction that makes me feel I am being cared by the companies.

                            <h3>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
                  </h3>
                            <p class="mb-0">Chatbot is a program that combines with artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with people. This tool can be used as a substitute for staff to provide consulting services to answer customers' questions. Its art is that it has two levels of complexity, the first one is stateless; this is when the chatbot interacts with new users through each conversation. On the other hand, the second level is stateful, this level appears when the chatbot is now able to recognize old conversation and can perform new responses to the users. Chatbot is mostly run by Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. With this technology, it helps the computer to understand the human language to provide the most natural responses related to requests of the users. Chatbot also requires big amount of data so that it can make correct identification of human and have conversation with them. At the current, there are two common types of chatbot are using by many businesses; firstly, Sales chatbot, this one is a sales support tool that can work 24/7, it always updates new information about customers’ thinking and experiences. With this Sales chatbot, business might not need to use Natural Language Processing, instead of that, they only need to use simple block like text, image, and the past conversation to interact with customers. The second one is the chatbot for customer services, by using collected data, this chatbot can answer common questionnaires from the customers. However, with more difficult questions, it will direct to the staffs to have conversation with customers for better responses. The process of chatbot has three stages, at the first stage which Translator, this is when user's information or requests will be translated into the programming language and the computer can then understand the tasks to be performed. In the second stage which is Processor, AI technology will be used to processes the user request. Then, in the Respondent stage, the computer receives the output from the AI and sends it back to the user corresponding to the results. According to Facebook Report, over 50% of users like shopping on the business which provide chatbots for them (Facebook Survey, 2020) leading to 80% of businesses are planning to use chatbots instead of human services to support customers in 2020 (Oracle Survey, 2020). One of the best platforms where businesses can easily build new chatbots is Facebook Messenger. In 2018, there 500.000 people was messaged by a chatbot on Facebook Messenger which is Blue Bot (Convince and Convert, ). Linked to my project idea about E-learning social media platform using chatbot to have better navigation for users, chatbot can be improved to become a robot teacher which can provide from low to high levels of knowledge through many interactive training elements such as videos, articles, and documents, etc. to help the learners to easily control their studying journey in the future (Greg Blackburn, 2019). Linked back to my project, as I mentioned that AI can be the online tutor for learners, but it acts like a User Experiences design; so chatbot acts like a User Interface design that allow the user to communicate with the AI. The chatbot can also become a motivation for the learners every day and it cannot lose patient leading them to contribute and train more (Dr Greg Blackburn, 2019).
        <hr>
                                Nowadays, many powerful businesses in different industries are using chatbots to replace human in communicating with the customers. They believe that the more chatbot interact with people, the smarter they are. As mentioned above that, 50% of users like online shopping in the shop that have chatbot, so the businesses have applied it to provide instruction/tutorial, speed up the process or communicate with the customers. Online assistants might be impacted a lot because more companies have cut of their work force to replace with chatbot, but human assistants can be hired to answer difficult questions that the bot cannot understand to response correctly. 
        <hr>
                            In daily life, I have been interacting with many chatbots that are provided by businesses. For example, on Facebook, Oppo have created their own chatbot to communicate with customers, after experiencing, I was surprising because it has answered the right responses that I am looking for. In the past, my mom was lazy to choose what types of pizza to order, but now, pizza 4P’s has built their own chatbot that can give instant recommendation for the users. Last Sunday, my mom easily ordered many foods from 4P’s to have a party at home. In my opinion, I think chatbot has influenced the lifestyle of my family and I, we are more active in communicate with technologies than before.
