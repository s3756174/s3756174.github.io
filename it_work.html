Then, they will do researching about the problems and the related information to brainstorm new system ideas and solutions to solve the issues. Programming, coding, and bug hunting will be used to implement the ideas into practical solutions. Later, proposal of the systems will be sent to the clients and the solution will be tested, also consultation will be opened to give the future decision. The engine often meets the clients such as government and businesses to know more about the problems. Then, they will have meeting with director to have permission about the new systems.

                    Like other careers, game developers also must check their emails and updates from internal social network to make a clear mindset for what to do in a workday. Coming up with timetable and tasks is a good practice for the developers to control the amount of work. After that, reading customers feedback or comments on the trial or beta version of the game to gain more customers’ insights about the game. Then, the game developers must jump right into coding for all day because the game is always needed to be updated to improve the customer’s experiences. After finish coding, they have to test the game again to see whether it works or not. If it works, consultation with managers and members will be brought out to state future problems and solutions. They also need to meet other departments like finance to look for expenses to run the game. Besides coding workplace, they also can enjoy playing video games to destress and generate new ideas. The challenging is understanding customer insights to develop to the game that can desire what customers really want. So, the developers have to do code all day.

                                    After observing videos, software engineers often spend their times to do exercises to refresh themselves for a new workday. Checking emails, past meeting agendas or internal updates is always important to create daily goals in order to achieve the productivity of the work. So, the engineers spend almost 60% of their times to reviews the code that they have done to recognize the mistakes or just simply check does the code work efficiently. If there are mistakes, debugging is another work that they have to do to fix the code correctly so the software can work smoothly. They also need to read news and documents about successful or new software to take ideas and improve from that. After everything, they have to create a presentation about their software project to have a consultation with the directors so they can have permission to implement their product. Moreover, it looks like that software engineers have a better worktime from others that allow them to have more free time to enjoy that helps them to relax.

After eating breakfast, they jump right in coding and debugging to develop the web. Then, they have online meeting with the clients such as businesses who need a new website. Later, the developers will have to consult with their teammates to discuss about the future issues and solutions of the new project. They spend most of their time approximately from 16 to 18 hours in the desk to do their work. The people they often interact with are the clients because they have to accept new requests from the customers. Team members or co-workers are also important people because the developers need to communicate with them to discuss about the problems/solutions and share the experiences to each other. The most challenging aspect in website developing is the developers have to base on customers’ insights to finish their product with perfection, it requires a lot of time to fix the code and debug.

After going to the workplace, they have a short stand-up meeting with other team members to discuss what they have done or what they should to improve the project. Then, they get back to their desk, start checking e-mails and build up daily goals to make work more productivity. They will begin to brainstorm ideas, code and design their project based on the customers’ insights and needs. The designers spend 50% of time for designing, 30% for meetings and 20% for data researching. Meetings happened every day, every time to discuss about the latest requests from customers and make decision on that. They also read more project documentaries and review other designs to support ideas brainstorming. The designers often meet the product managers to have clear understanding about the customers’ requests. They also meet other engineers and cross-functional teams to transmit their ideas that can help these departments to implement the projects for the clients. Their most challenging aspect is that 50% of their skills required is designing and the other 50% is presenting. Presenting is important, they have to practice every day to transmit their product information and ideas to the other people like managers, engineers or even the clients to help them easily understand what is saying.
