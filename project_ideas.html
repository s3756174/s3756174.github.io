					<h3>E-Learning Social Media Platform
            Overview
          </h3>
					<p class="mb-0">Based on Ken Research in 2019, the E-learning market in Vietnam is expected to reach 3 billion USD due to the growth of nearly 3000 schools that will apply E-learning because of a lack of teaching strengths (Ken Research, 2019). Besides, according to Hootsuite digital report in 2020, there are up to 65 million users online on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube (Simon Kemp, 2020). With the data above, my project idea is providing an E-learning platform that also include social media features to create the best experience for RMIT users.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-7 content-left mt-lg-0 mt-5 pl-lg-5">
					<h3>Motivation
          </h3>
					<p class="mb-0"> At the current, Student Academic Success is where learners can improve their skills and knowledge through one-to-one learning and a wide range of resources. However, they still have a lack of human resources and a limit in providing enough sections that can be suitable for students’ timetables leading learners to skip the sections and often have low scores in their assignments. Moreover, students often go to the RMIT community on Facebook to ask others for tips and experiences about the assignments, they use their personal accounts which can lead to a leak of information, so my solution in this situation is to provide this safer E-learning Social Media Platform for learners to have opportunity to communicate directly online with the experts with better security.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-7 content-left mt-lg-0 mt-5 pl-lg-5">
        <h3>Description
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-0">Firstly, my E-learning Social Media Platform has the same basic purpose with other E-learning platforms which creates a classroom experiences for users such as Q&A, discussion, games, projects, or quizzes. These experiences bring up interaction between instructors and learners or learners and learners, so the contents for this project are significantly important. To prevent students from being disoriented when they visit the platform, on the home page, it just needs to include general content such as lists of courses and notifications of news or other status about their courses. Later pages will have more in-depth contents about the courses such as topic videos, articles, etc. that are made and shared by experts. Secondly, this project is also a social media platform, so it also needs to have notifications from other users. They can post their problems and statements on the home page and other can have comments to create discussion. The discussion helps user to study more about a topic in different views and insights which they have more solutions to solve their problems. Moreover, my platform also provides private messenger like other social media channels, users can send privately send message to their lecturers and teammates or other experts to have more faster details and solutions about their assignments or issues. These features and contents can improve the interaction between users which will support my project to become a robust platform. In additional, AI chatbot would be a highlight in my project; based on my research, there are no E-learning platforms have chatbots. I think chatbot could be a potential way to support users and navigate them to the right resources. The chatbot is an AI that use the data to have an advisory for the user and there are three steps in the process. At the beginning, the requests from users will be translated in to programming language to help the system understand. Then, the Artificial Intelligence will handle all the requests and send back to the system. After receiving the responses from AI, the system will return the answers for the user on the messenger. Lastly, I want to provide a safety online platform where people can share their knowledge and have communication with each other, so my priority for users is to avoid hacking and leak of personal information. When the users want to join E-learning social media platform, they have to user their RMIT accounts which using their student ID. This action prevents them from being stalked by other users or no important information will be leaked.   </p>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-0">For my E-learning social media platform, I think hardware is not important to be used. However, I need to have a strong knowledge about software such as Visual Studio Code where I can use programming languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to build up the platform. To have a free template, I can search for the free bootstrap template to easier create my own project website. Chatterbot and AI are the technologies that I also needed in my project, with these technologies I can use free websites like Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio or Chatfuel.com to create a machine learning process for my chatbot and AI.    </p>

      <div class="col-lg-7 content-left mt-lg-0 mt-5 pl-lg-5">
        <h3>Skills
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-0">The most important skill is website designing, I believe that if a website or platform want to attract users, it needs to have a good quality and design with a clear order of title tag, meta description and headings. It also must provide convenient buttons which it can drive the users directly into what they need. Secondly, having good content writing is also required, the clear contents will support users easily understand about what is happening on the website. Lastly, be good in using machine learning is also important because the highlight in my project is the chatbot. So, in order to make the chatbot work effectively, I need to be good in coming up with the answers that related to the questionnaires from the users’ insights.    </p>

      <p class="my-3 head"> I believe that if my E-learning Social Media Platform is successful, it can solve the limitation in joining SAS sections from the RMIT learners because they now can access to the platform and easily find solutions to solve their problems in academy. They can also build relationships with other leaners and experts which can help them in learning new things and improving communication.</p>
