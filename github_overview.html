        <p> Git:
            Git is a system used to control many project open-source distributed versions by developers. Git provides each developer a repository for them to store all changes in the project. Different from other system, Git stores versions of files as snapshots that allow developers to adjust or fix their files in the middle of the project. Nowadays, a project requires many developers to work in parallel, so Git appears to resolve the conflict of developers in the process of implementing the project. High security, improving better communication between developers and allowing them to revert and modify old codes are the benefits of Git.

            GitHub: 
            GitHub works like a social media with feeds and followers for developers to run their projects. It applies Git to control and synchronize the team’s source code on one server where developers can communicate to each other. GitHub is used to easily manage source code where developers can commit and comment on their work for the project. It also helps developers to track the changes of versions that happened during the project. Besides technical pros, this is where developers can meet other people to share about their experiences and learn new things.

           <h1> How to install Git </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>We choose the latest version of Git with 64 bit and when the install has begun, we need to set up Git follow the instructions to complete installation. Then, we can use either command line of Windows or Git bash in Visual Studio to check the Git version.

        <p>-config: used to set username and email in the main configuration file. For example, to check username use git config – global user.name and to check email use git config – global user.email .
            -add: used to add changes into working directory using git add. 
            -commit: every time, changes are made, they will be stores by using git commit. It will store the history of changes with the username and email of the developers whenever they commit something. They can also share their messages to other members to recognize about these changes.  
            -push: after using git add and git commit to make changes, git push will be used to upload these changes into the working directory. 
        </p>

        <p>First, we must set up our username and email and then make sure that we are in our working (repository) directory. 
            Secondly, we use git pull to get the latest version of the code and apply git checkout to check what branch are we in. 
            After that, we open the code file to change design and content, then we save the file.
            We will use git add to add changed file into repository directory and git commit to store these changes and send messages to other members about modification. Finally, we use git push to push everything into the repository directory. 
        </p>

            <h1> Branch</h1>
        </header>
        <hr>
        <p>Branched branches will not affect another branch, so developers can perform multiple changes simultaneously in the same repository. Moreover, all branched branches can be merged with other branches to become the main branch. Developer in each branch cannot affect others, after finished all the changes, they will upload these into the main branch. By having a history of changes, developers can easily modify mistakes inside the code anytime.
